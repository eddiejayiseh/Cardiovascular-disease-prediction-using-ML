# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Project Conclusion Report

## Project Overview

Cardiovascular disease prediction is a critical task in the field of healthcare. This project aims to develop a machine-learning model that accurately predicts the presence of cardiovascular disease based on various patient attributes. The dataset used contains information about patients' age, gender, height, weight, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and other relevant features.

## Data Preprocessing

The initial step involved loading the dataset and performing data preprocessing. The 'id' column, which does not contribute to the analysis, was dropped. Missing values were checked and handled if present. The data was then split into features (X) and the target variable (y).

## Data Analysis and Visualization

Exploratory data analysis was conducted to gain insights into the dataset and identify patterns or relationships between features and the target variable. The distribution of cardiovascular disease cases was visualized, and the correlation matrix was plotted to observe feature relationships.

Age, cholesterol, and weight were found to have strong relationships with the target variable, indicating their importance in predicting cardiovascular disease.

## Model Training and Evaluation

Five machine learning models were trained on the dataset: Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. Each model's accuracy was evaluated on the test set, and the results are as follows:

- Support Vector Machine Accuracy: 0.7319
- K-Nearest Neighbors Accuracy: 0.6499
- Decision Tree Accuracy: 0.6286
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: 0.7236
- Random Forest Accuracy: 0.7137

Among the models, the Support Vector Machine achieved the highest accuracy, closely followed by Logistic Regression. However, the Random Forest model also showed promising performance.

## Model Interpretation

The feature importances of the Random Forest model were analyzed to identify the most influential features. Age, cholesterol, weight, and systolic blood pressure (ap_hi) were found to be the most important features in predicting cardiovascular disease. These results align with existing medical knowledge, as these factors are significant risk indicators.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project successfully developed and evaluated machine learning models for cardiovascular disease prediction. The Support Vector Machine demonstrated the highest accuracy, making it a strong candidate for deployment in real-world scenarios. The Random Forest model also exhibited competitive performance and provides valuable insights through feature importance.

However, there is room for further improvement and exploration. Future work may involve collecting additional relevant data, fine-tuning model hyperparameters, and experimenting with other advanced machine-learning techniques.

The developed model can serve as a valuable tool in identifying individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease, enabling timely interventions and personalized healthcare strategies. It is important to ensure rigorous validation and testing before deploying the model in clinical or practical settings.
